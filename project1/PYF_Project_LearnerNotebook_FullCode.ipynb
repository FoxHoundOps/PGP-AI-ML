    "### Context\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of restaurants in New York is increasing day by day. Lots of students and busy professionals rely on those restaurants due to their hectic lifestyles. Online food delivery service is a great option for them. It provides them with good food from their favorite restaurants. A food aggregator company FoodHub offers access to multiple restaurants through a single smartphone app.\n",
    "\n",
    "The app allows the restaurants to receive a direct online order from a customer. The app assigns a delivery person from the company to pick up the order after it is confirmed by the restaurant. The delivery person then uses the map to reach the restaurant and waits for the food package. Once the food package is handed over to the delivery person, he/she confirms the pick-up in the app and travels to the customer's location to deliver the food. The delivery person confirms the drop-off in the app after delivering the food package to the customer. The customer can rate the order in the app. The food aggregator earns money by collecting a fixed margin of the delivery order from the restaurants.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The food aggregator company has stored the data of the different orders made by the registered customers in their online portal. They want to analyze the data to get a fair idea about the demand of different restaurants which will help them in enhancing their customer experience. Suppose you are hired as a Data Scientist in this company and the Data Science team has shared some of the key questions that need to be answered. Perform the data analysis to find answers to these questions that will help the company to improve the business. \n",

    "### Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The data contains the different data related to a food order. The detailed data dictionary is given below.\n",

    "### Data Dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "* order_id: Unique ID of the order\n",
    "* customer_id: ID of the customer who ordered the food\n",
    "* restaurant_name: Name of the restaurant\n",
    "* cuisine_type: Cuisine ordered by the customer\n",
    "* cost: Cost of the order\n",
    "* day_of_the_week: Indicates whether the order is placed on a weekday or weekend (The weekday is from Monday to Friday and the weekend is Saturday and Sunday)\n",
    "* rating: Rating given by the customer out of 5\n",
    "* food_preparation_time: Time (in minutes) taken by the restaurant to prepare the food. This is calculated by taking the difference between the timestamps of the restaurant's order confirmation and the delivery person's pick-up confirmation.\n",
    "* delivery_time: Time (in minutes) taken by the delivery person to deliver the food package. This is calculated by taking the difference between the timestamps of the delivery person's pick-up confirmation and drop-off information"

    "\n",
    "*  Because American, Japanese, Italian and Chinese cuisine types are the most popular and account for just over 80% of all orders, I would advise to promote these cuisine types as the data shows these are the most popular with customers.\n",
    "* Because most orders placed are in the \\$12-\\$17 (based on our univariate analysis of cost of the order), I would advise to promote food items within this range in order because based on the data, this seems to be a range that customers are comfortable with and if they see easily see food items in this range, they may be more likely to go ahead and order. Then at checkout, consider offering the customer a discount or coupon for future use if they add-on some food item that will bring their total to just over $20. Something like \"You are $3.92 away from saving 5% on your next order!\" This way the food aggregator business is more likely to achieve that 25% of the food order total .\n",
    "* Another reccomendation is to create coupons and offer discounts to help customers get their cost of the order in that \\$12-\\$17 range in order to appeal to those customers who are adamant about not spending more than $20 on their order. The idea here is that if you cannot get a customer to get their cost of the order to over $20, get it as close to $20 as possible and still in a range that they are comfortable with (\\$12-\\$17, but hopefully closer to $17). \n",
